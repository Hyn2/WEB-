          >The World Wide Web (WWW)</a
        >, commonly known as the Web, is an information system enabling
        documents and other web resources to be accessed over the Internet.<br />
        Documents and downloadable media are made available to the network
        through web servers and can be accessed by programs such as web
        browsers.<br />
        Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located
        through character strings called uniform resource locators (URLs).<br />
        The original and still very common document type is a web page formatted
        in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).<br />
        This markup language supports plain text, images, embedded video and
        audio contents, and scripts (short programs) that implement complex user
        interaction.<br />
        The HTML language also supports hyperlinks (embedded URLs) which provide
        immediate access to other web resources.<br />
        Web navigation, or web surfing, is the common practice of following such
        hyperlinks across multiple websites.<br />
        Web applications are web pages that function as application software.<br />
        The information in the Web is transferred across the Internet using the
        Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).<br />
        Multiple web resources with a common theme and usually a common domain
        name make up a website.<br />
        A single web server may provide multiple websites, while some websites,
        especially the most popular ones, may be provided by multiple
        servers.<br />
        Website content is provided by a myriad of companies, organizations,
        government agencies, and individual users; and comprises an enormous
        amount of educational, entertainment, commercial, and government
        information.<br />
        The World Wide Web has become the world's dominant software platform. It
        is the primary tool billions of people worldwide use to interact with
        the Internet.<br />
        The Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989 and opened to
        the public in 1991.<br />
        It was conceived as a "universal linked information system".<br />
